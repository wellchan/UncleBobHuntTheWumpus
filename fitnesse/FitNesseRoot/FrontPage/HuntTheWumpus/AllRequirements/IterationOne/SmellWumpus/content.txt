If the wumpus is in any adjacent cavern, you should be able to smell it.

To do this we'll freeze the wumpus so that it doesn't move around.  Then we'll place the player near the Wumpus and see if the "Smell" message is emitted.

!include <HuntTheWumpus.CrossMap

!define SMELL {You smell the Wumpus.}

The bats move from cavern to cavern every 15 turns approximately.

Make sure the Bats move randomly.

use a tiny cross map
{{{
   [4]
[1][2][3]
   [5]
}}}

|Make map.|
|start|end|direction|
|1|2|E|
|2|3|E|
|4|2|S|
|2|5|S|

Now repeat the following 10000 times.
 1 Put the bats in cavern 2.
 2 rest
 3 note where the bats are.

|Check random bat movement|
